# ZXSpect
ZX Spectrum 48k emulator for the PicoPad console

This emulator is based on the code https://github.com/MikeDX/z80emu.
It also uses parts of code from other emulators:
QtSpecem emulator - TAP file loading
ZX-ESPectrum - Z80 file loading
Ziga Ramsak's ZX Spectrum - SNA file loading

The code requires the SDK from https://github.com/Panda381/PicoLibSDK to compile
